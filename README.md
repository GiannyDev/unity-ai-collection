# 🧠 Unity AI Systems Showcase

This repository features a modular collection of artificial intelligence systems implemented in Unity. It's designed for both educational purposes, showcasing a variety of AI techniques used in modern games and simulations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Finite State Machines (FSM)**  
  State-driven AI for predictable behavior switching.

- 🌳 **Behavior Trees**  
  Hierarchical decision-making for complex and flexible AI logic.

- 🐦 **Flocking (Boids Behavior)**  
  Group movement simulation for swarms, birds, fish, or crowd dynamics.

- 🎯 **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)**  
  Dynamic goal-based planning where agents make intelligent decisions on the fly.

- 🧭 **Pathfinding (A*)**  
  A* pathfinding for efficient navigation.
